  This quiz was written with HTML and Javascript and formatted with CSS.  Upon clicking the start button, the user is tasked with answering a series of randomly generated questions with randomly generated questions, which gauges their skill in Javascript.  There is a 120 second time limit imposed upon the quiz.

  After selecting an answer, the application will advise them whether they have answered the question correctly or incorrectly.  In the event of a correct answer, 2 seconds are added to the clock.  Upon selecting an incorrect answer, 10 seconds are subtracted from the clock.  

  The user's score is the time they have remaining on the clock when all questions are answered.  After the quiz, an alert shows the user their score and redirects them to the high scores page, where they can enter their name for record keeping.  A list of the highest 10 scores are kept in the browser's storage.

  After viewing the high scores, the user can click the link at the bottom of the page to return to the beginning of the quiz to try again.
